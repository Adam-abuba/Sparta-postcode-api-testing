# Sparta Postcode API Testing
The task was to use the API provided by postcode.io and run numerous test on it using rspec to get an understanding of the generation of the data and how we can extract specfic pieces of data that which we had parsed.


## Setup 
- Once you access the GitHub repository you can obtain the files by either taking the repository clone link and running `git clone [insert clone link here]`.
- You can also obtain the files by directly downloading them from GitHub as a zip file.
- The test are contained within the spec but in order to run the test after entering sparta-postcode-api-testing folder use the terminal to run `rspec` and the test will be carried out displaying the results.
